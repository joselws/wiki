# wiki
Second project for "Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" course 2020 on edX by cs50 - HarvardX.

util.py file was provided by course staff.

This project consists on a wiki, in which users can see existing pages, edit them, and create new pages. Pages are written in markdown and translated to for rendering.

This project showcased basic use of Python, Django and Django Forms. For this project, the following requirements had to be met:

- Let users access the page of an entry via URL.
  - In case the entry doesn't exist, present an error page to the user.
- Implement an index page in which the title of every wiki entry presented in a link that takes the user to see the selected entry page.
- A search bar where the user is presented with all possible matches for his/her query.
- Let users create their own entries through a page which that contains all the required form fields.
- Let users edit existing entries.
- Implement a 'Random Page' link that takes the user to a random entry page among all existing entries.
- Convert the markdown content of each entry to HTML when presented on their view page.
